# NeRF from Scratch

![NeRF Rendering](screenshot/nerf.png)

A PyTorch implementation of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) built from scratch. This implementation focuses on learning and understanding the core concepts of NeRF while maintaining good performance and code readability.

## Overview

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) represent scenes as continuous 5D functions that output the radiance emitted in each direction (θ, φ) at each point (x, y, z) in space. This implementation includes:

- Custom NeRF model with positional encoding
- Volume rendering pipeline
- Training on synthetic datasets
- Inference with novel view synthesis

## Requirements

```bash
torch>=1.8.0
numpy>=1.19.2
Pillow>=8.0.0
tqdm>=4.50.0
```

```

## Training

The training pipeline includes:
- Positional encoding for coordinates and view directions
- Hierarchical sampling along rays
- Efficient batch processing with chunked rays
- Learning rate scheduling
- Gradient clipping for stability
- Automatic checkpointing

To train the model:

```bash
python source/train.py
```

Training parameters:
- Learning rate: 1e-4 with exponential decay (gamma=0.995)
- Batch size: 1 (processes multiple rays per batch)
- Number of epochs: 200 * 2 (trainning best checkpoint again for 200 epochs)
- Positional encoding frequencies: 10 (positions), 4 (directions)
- Network size: 256 hidden units

## Inference

For rendering novel views:

```bash
python source/inference.py
```

The inference script:
- Loads trained model weights
- Generates novel camera trajectories
- Renders images from new viewpoints
- Creates a GIF of the rendered views

## Dataset

This implementation uses the synthetic NeRF dataset (specifically the 'chair' scene). The dataset should be organized as:

```
nerf_synthetic/
└── chair/
    ├── train/
    │   └── *.png
    ├── test/
    │   └── *.png
    ├── transforms_train.json
    └── transforms_test.json
```

   - Benefits of clean tensor management

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Memory Management**:
   - Adjust chunk size based on your GPU memory
   - Clear unused tensors during training
   - Use gradient checkpointing for larger scenes

2. **Training Stability**:
   - Start with a lower learning rate (1e-4)
   - Use gradient clipping (max_norm=0.1)
   - Monitor the running average loss

3. **Quality Improvements**:
   - Increase sampling points for better quality
   - Adjust near/far bounds based on scene
   - Fine-tune positional encoding frequencies
  
## Hardware Requirements & Training Time

This implementation has been tested on:
- NVIDIA T4 GPU
- Training time: ~3 hours for 200 epochs on the chair dataset (for 400 epochs, took around 5-6 hrs)
- Inference time: ~2-3 seconds/image for rendering a complete 360° view

Note: Performance can vary based on:
- Scene complexity
- Number of rays per batch
- Sampling points per ray
